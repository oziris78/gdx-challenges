# GDX Challenges

This repository was inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain">The Coding Train</a>'s series called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH">Coding Challenges</a>. <br>

The package called `zexercises` has the simple challenges that were implemented. <br>

Every other package has a specific challenge in them.

This repo, in addition to the known libgdx libraries uses two of my libraries:
  - <a href="https://github.com/oziris78/toria-math">Toria Math</a>
  - <a href="https://github.com/oziris78/toria-gdx">Toria GDX</a>
